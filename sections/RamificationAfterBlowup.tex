The main theorem of this section is
\begin{restatable}{theorem}{SymmetricPowerOfSheafIsTamelyRamified}\label{theorem:SymmetricPowerOfSheafIsTamelyRamified}
     Let $\Lambda$ be a finite ring of cardinality invertible in $k$, and let $\cF$ be an \'etale sheaf of $\Lambda$-modules, locally free of rank 1 on $U$, with ramification bounded by $\mdls$. 
     Considering $U^{(d)}$ as an open subscheme of the blowup $\tilde{C}^{(d)}_\mdls$ of $C^{(d)}$, we have that
     for sufficiently large integer $d$, $\cF^{(d)}$ is tamely ramified on $H= \tilde{C}^{(d)}_\mdls \setminus U^{(d)}=Z_0 \times_{C^{(d)}} \tilde{C}^{(d)}_\mdls $.
\end{restatable}

Recall the defintions from \Cref{section:BlowupOfSymmetricPowerOfCurves},
$\ndls \subset \mdls$ a submodulus, $Z_\ndls$ is the closed subscheme of 
$C^{(\deg \ndls)}$ defined by $\ndls$ as a point.
$X_\ndls$ as the blowup of $C^{(\deg \ndls)}$ at 
$Z_\ndls$, and $E_\ndls = Z_\ndls \times_{C^{(d)}} X_\ndls$ is exceptional divisor of this blowup with 
$\eta_\ndls$ its generic point.

\Cref{theorem:SymmetricPowerOfSheafIsTamelyRamified} easily follows from: 
\begin{theorem}
     Let $\cF$ be a local system on $U$ with ramification at $P$ bounded by $\ndls = k_P P \subset \mdls$.
     Then $\cF^{(\deg \ndls)}$ is tamely ramified on $E_\ndls$
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}[Proof of \Cref{theorem:SymmetricPowerOfSheafIsTamelyRamified}]
     Let $\cF$ be as in \Cref{theorem:SymmetricPowerOfSheafIsTamelyRamified}, $\mdls = \sum_{i=1}^n k_P P$ with $\deg P = d_P$  
     Then for every $\ndls \subset \mdls$ of the form $\ndls = k_P P$, $\cF^{(d)}$ has ramification 
\end{proof}
