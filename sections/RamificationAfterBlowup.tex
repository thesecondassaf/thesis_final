\textcolor{red}{do we assume here $S=k$?}
The main theorem of this section is
\begin{restatable}{theorem}{SymmetricPowerOfSheafIsTamelyRamified}\label{theorem:SymmetricPowerOfSheafIsTamelyRamified}
     Let $\Lambda$ be a finite ring of cardinality invertible in $k$, and let $\cF$ be an \'etale sheaf of $\Lambda$-modules, locally free of rank 1 on $U$, with ramification bounded by $\mdls$. 
     Considering $U^{(d)}$ as an open subscheme of the blowup $\tilde{C}^{(d)}_\mdls$ of $C^{(d)}$, we have that
     for sufficiently large integer $d$, $\cF^{(d)}$ is tamely ramified on $H= \tilde{C}^{(d)}_\mdls \setminus U^{(d)}=E_0 \times_{C^{(d)}} \tilde{C}^{(d)}_\mdls $.
\end{restatable}

Following the notation of \Cref{section:BlowupOfSymmetricPowerOfCurves},
For any modulus $\ndls \subset \mdls$, we define $Z_\ndls$ as the closed subscheme of $C^{(\deg \ndls)}$ 
defined by $\ndls$ as a point of $C^{(\deg \ndls)}$ .

We then define $X_\ndls$ as the blowup of $C^{(\deg \ndls)}$ at $Z_\ndls$,
and we denote by $E_\ndls = Z_\ndls \times_{C^{(d)}} X_\ndls$ the exceptional divisor of this blowup, it is irreducible of codimension 1.
We denote by $\eta_\ndls$ the generic point of $E_\ndls$. 
Diagrammatically:
\begin{equation}\label{equation:blowup_diagram_ndls}
  \begin{tikzcd}
\overline{\{\eta_\ndls \}} =  E_\ndls \arrow[r, hook] \arrow[d] & X_\ndls \arrow[d, "\pi_\ndls"] \\
Z_\ndls \arrow[r, hook]           & C^{(\deg \ndls)}          
\end{tikzcd}   
\end{equation}



% Recall the defintions from \Cref{section:BlowupOfSymmetricPowerOfCurves},
% $\ndls \subset \mdls$ a submodulus, $Z_\ndls$ is the closed subscheme of 
% $C^{(\deg \ndls)}$ defined by $\ndls$ as a point.
% $X_\ndls$ as the blowup of $C^{(\deg \ndls)}$ at 
% $Z_\ndls$, and $E_\ndls = Z_\ndls \times_{C^{(d)}} X_\ndls$ is exceptional divisor of this blowup with 
% $\eta_\ndls$ its generic point.

\Cref{theorem:SymmetricPowerOfSheafIsTamelyRamified} easily follows from: 
\begin{theorem}\label{theorem:SymmetricPowerOfSheavesIsTamelyRamifiedReduction}
     Let $\cF$ be a local system on $U$ with ramification at $P$ bounded by $\ndls = k_P P \subset \mdls$.
     Then $\cF^{(\deg \ndls)}$ is tamely ramified at $\eta_\ndls$ of $E_\ndls$
\end{theorem}

In the upcoming section, we perform the reduction and derive \Cref{theorem:SymmetricPowerOfSheafIsTamelyRamified} from 
\Cref{theorem:SymmetricPowerOfSheavesIsTamelyRamifiedReduction}. 
We then prove \Cref{theorem:SymmetricPowerOfSheavesIsTamelyRamifiedReduction} in the section that follows.

\subsection{Reduction Lemmas}

The following lemma is adapted from \cite{takeuchi2019blow} (Lemma 4.1)
\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:takeuchi_lemma}
     Let $C$ be a projective, smooth, and geometrically connected curve over a perfect field $k$. 
     Let $\mathfrak{m} = \sum_{i=1}^{r} k_i P_i$ be an effective divisor where $P_1, \dots, P_r$ are distinct closed points. 
     Let $U = C \setminus \mathfrak{m}$ and let $d \geq \deg \mathfrak{m}$.

     Suppose $\mathfrak{n}_1, \dots, \mathfrak{n}_l$ are pairwise coprime submoduli of $\mathfrak{m}$ such that $\mathfrak{m} = \sum_{j=1}^l \mathfrak{n}_j$. 
     Consider the summation morphism:
     \[
     \pi : C^{(\deg \mathfrak{n}_1)} \times_k \dots \times_k C^{(\deg \mathfrak{n}_l)} \times_k C^{(d - \deg \mathfrak{m})} \longrightarrow C^{(d)}
     \]
     defined by $(D_1, \dots, D_l, D_{extra}) \mapsto \sum_{j=1}^l D_j + D_{extra}$.

     Then $\pi$ is étale at the generic point of the closed subvariety 
     \[
     V = \{\mathfrak{n}_1\} \times_k \dots \times_k \{\mathfrak{n}_l\} \times_k C^{(d - \deg \mathfrak{m})}
     \]
     inside the domain $C^{(\deg \mathfrak{n}_1)} \times_k \dots \times_k C^{(\deg \mathfrak{n}_l)} \times_k C^{(d - \deg \mathfrak{m})}$.

\begin{proof}
     We may assume that $k$ is algebraically closed (hence $\deg P_i = 1$ for all $i$). By miracle flatness $\pi$ is finite flat. 
     Thus, it is enough to show that there exists a closed point $Q$ of $\ndls_1 + \dots \ndls_l + C^{(d - \deg \mathfrak{m})} \subset C^{(d)}$ 
     over which there are $\deg \pi$ points on $C^{(\ndls_1)} \times_k \dots \times_k C^{(\ndls_l)} \times_k C^{(d - \deg \mathfrak{m})}$. (Because it will be unramified 
     at this point and thus also at the generic point of $V$.)
     Choose $Q$ as a point corresponding to a divisor
     $\ndls_1 + \dots + \ndls_l + P_{r+1} + \dots + P_{r+d - \deg \mathfrak{m}}$, where $P_1, \dots, P_{r+d - \deg \mathfrak{m}}$ are distinct points of $U(k)$.
\end{proof}     
\end{lemma}

\begin{cor}
     The morphism $C^{(\deg \mdls)} \times_k C^{(d - \deg \mdls)} \xrightarrow[]{\pi} C^{(d)}$
     is finite flat everywhere, and étale at the generic point of the closed subvariety
     $Z_\mdls \times_k C^{(d - \deg \mdls)} \subset C^{(\deg \mdls)} \times_k C^{(d - \deg \mdls)}$.     
\end{cor}

Following from this, we look at the following diagram, coming from the flat base change 
$C^{(d - \deg \mdls)} \to \Spec(k)$ (\Cref{prop:symmetric_power_flat_base_change}) of \Cref{equation:blowup_diagram_ndls}:
(\textcolor{red}{Is this even smooth? })

\[\begin{tikzcd}
E_{\mdls} \times_k C^{(d-\deg \mdls)} \arrow[r] \arrow[d] & X_{\mdls} \times_k C^{(d-\deg \mdls)} \arrow[d] & \cF^{(\deg \mdls)} \times_k C^{(d-\deg \mdls)} \arrow[d, color=purple] \\
Z_\mdls \times_k C^{(d-\deg \mdls)} \arrow[r] & C^{(\deg \mdls)} \times_k C^{(d-\deg \mdls)} & U^{(\deg \mdls)} \times_k C^{(d-\deg \mdls)} \arrow[lu]
\end{tikzcd}\]

Note that $U^{(\deg \mdls)} \times_k C^{(d-\deg \mdls)}$ is dense open subscheme of $X_{\mdls} \times_k C^{(d-\deg \mdls)}$,
And $E_{\mdls} \times_k C^{(d-\deg \mdls)}$ is a prime divisor of $X_{\mdls} \times_k C^{(d-\deg \mdls)}$.
Hence it is well defined question according to \Cref{definition:tamely_ramified_in_codim_1} to ask whether
$\cF^{(\deg \mdls)} \times_k C^{(d-\deg \mdls)}$ is tamely ramified at the generic point $\theta$ of
$E_{\mdls} \times_k C^{(d-\deg \mdls)}$.

\begin{lemma}
     If $\cF^{(\deg \mdls)}$ is tamely ramified at $\eta_\mdls$, then
     $\cF^{(\deg \mdls)} \times_k C^{(d-\deg \mdls)}$ is tamely ramified at the generic point $\theta$ of
     $E_{\mdls} \times_k C^{(d-\deg \mdls)}$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    This follows from \stackstag{0EYD}
    \textcolor{red}{make adjusments to definition and lemma, to only require that some prime divisors are with desired properties.}
\end{proof}


Replacing $C^{(d - \deg \mdls)}$ with the dense open subscheme $U^{(d - \deg \mdls)} \subset C^{(d - \deg \mdls)}$,
we get that the $G$-torsor $p_1^{-1} \cP^{(\deg \mdls)}$ ($\cP$ correspodns to $\cF$ under \Cref{prop:torsor_module_equivalence})
is tamely ramified at $\theta$ the generic point of
$E_{\mdls} \times_k U^{(d-\deg \mdls)} \subset U^{(\deg \mdls)} \times_k U^{(d - \deg \mdls)}$,
where $p_1: U^{(\deg \mdls)} \times_k U^{(d - \deg \mdls)} \to U^{(\deg \mdls)}$ is the projection to the first factor.

Looking at the second projection $p_2:X_{\mdls} \times_k U^{(d - \deg \mdls)} \to U^{(d - \deg \mdls)}$, and the fact that 
$\cP^{(d - \deg \mdls)}$ is \'etale on $U^{(d - \deg \mdls)}$ we get that 
$p_2^{-1} \cP^{(d - \deg \mdls)}= X_{\mdls} \times_k \cP^{(d - \deg \mdls)}$ is \'etale on $X_{\mdls} \times_k U^{(d - \deg \mdls)}$.
Hence, its restriction to $U^{(\deg \mdls)} \times_k U^{(d - \deg \mdls)}$ is unramified at $\theta$.

Thus, by the following lemma, we conclude that $\boxP{\cP^{(\deg \mdls)}}{\cP^{(d - \deg \mdls)}} = p_1^{-1} \cP^{(\deg \mdls)} \wedge^G p_2^{-1} \cP^{(d - \deg \mdls)}$
     is tamely ramified at $\theta$ the generic point of $E_{\mdls} \times_k U^{(d-\deg \mdls)}$.

\begin{lemma}
     Let $X \to \spec k$ be a scheme over a field $k$, and let $\cP_1, \cP_2$ be two $G$-torsors on $U_{et}$.
     Let $\xi$ be the generic point of a prime divisor $D \subset X$.
     If $\cP_1$ is tamely ramified at $\xi$, and $\cP_2$ is unramified at $\xi$,
     then the contracted product $\cP_1 \wedge^G \cP_2$ is tamely ramified at $\xi$.
\end{lemma}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
We thus claim that the contracted product,

is tamely ramified at $\theta$ the generic point of
$E_{\mdls} \times_k U^{(d-\deg \mdls)}$.

\begin{cor}
     Let $\mdls$ be a modulus as above, and let $\eta_\mdls$ be the generic point of $E_\mdls$.
     Let $\cP$ be a $G$-torsor on $U_{et}$ with ramification bounded by $\mdls$.
     Assume $\cP^{(\deg \mdls)}$ is tamely ramified at $\eta_\mdls$.
     Then $\Fbox{\deg \mdls}{d - \deg \mdls}$ is tamely ramified at the generic point $\theta$ of 
     $E_{\mdls} \times_k C^{(d-\deg \mdls)} \subset C^{(\deg \mdls)} \times_k C^{(d - \deg \mdls)}$
     And $\cP^{(d)}$ is tamely ramified at the generic point $\eta_0=\eta_{\mdls,d}$ of $E_0=E_{\mdls,d}$
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
     We look at the diagram:
     \[\begin{tikzcd}
     E_{\mdls} \times_k C^{(d - \deg \mdls)} \arrow[r, hook] \arrow[d] & C^{(\deg \mdls)} \times_k C^{(d - \deg \mdls)} \arrow[d, "\pi
     "] \\
     Z_{\mdls} \arrow[r, hook]           & C^{(d)}          
     \end{tikzcd}\] 
     \textcolor{red}{Compete and make precise.}
\end{proof}


\begin{lemma}
     Let $\ndls_1, \ndls_2 \subset \mdls$ be two moduli of the form $\ndls_1 = k_1 P_1$, $\ndls_2 = k_2 P_2$ where $P_1, P_2$ are distinct points.
     Assume $\cF ^{(\deg \ndls_1)}$, $\cF ^{(\deg \ndls_2)}$ are at most tamely ramified at $\eta_{\ndls_1}$, $\eta_{\ndls_2}$ respectively.
     Then $\cF^{(\deg \ndls_1 + \deg \ndls_2)}$ is at most tamely tamified at $\eta_{\ndls_1 + \ndls_2}$ .
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
     \textcolor{red}{Complete}
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:moduli_reduction}
     Let $\ndls, \ndls' \subset \mdls$ be coprime sub moduli of $\mdls$ where $\ndls' = k_P P$.
     Assume $\cF ^{(\deg \ndls)}$, $\cF ^{(\deg \ndls')}$ are at most tamely ramified at $\eta_{\ndls}$, $\eta_{\ndls'}$ respectively.
     Then $\cF^{(\deg \ndls + \deg \ndls')}$ is at most tamely tamified at $\eta_{\ndls + \ndls'}$ .

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Proof of \Cref{theorem:SymmetricPowerOfSheafIsTamelyRamified}}{Proof of Theorem X}}
\begin{proof}[Proof of \Cref{theorem:SymmetricPowerOfSheafIsTamelyRamified}]
     Let $\cF$ be as in \Cref{theorem:SymmetricPowerOfSheafIsTamelyRamified}, $\mdls = \sum_{i=1}^n k_P P$ with $\deg P = d_P$  
     Then by \Cref{theorem:SymmetricPowerOfSheavesIsTamelyRamifiedReduction} for every $\ndls \subset \mdls$ of the form $\ndls = k_P P$, $\cF^{(\deg \ndls)}$ is at most tamely ramified at $\eta_\ndls$.
     By \Cref{lemma:moduli_reduction}, $\cF^{(\deg \mdls)}$ is then at most tamely ramified at $\eta_\mdls$. And thus by lemma \Cref{lemma:takeuchi_lemma} 
     (\textcolor{red}{maybe do another step here directly, in addition to the lemma?})
     $\cF^{(d)}$ is tamely ramified at the generic point of $H$.
\end{proof}


\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Proof of \Cref{theorem:SymmetricPowerOfSheavesIsTamelyRamifiedReduction}}{Proof of Theorem Y}}
In this section we prove \Cref{theorem:SymmetricPowerOfSheavesIsTamelyRamifiedReduction}
\textcolor{red}{complete - this is not finished}

We will work this out along an example:
Let $X=\bG_m=\spec R[t, t^{-1}]$ and Let $\cP=\bG_m \xrightarrow[]{(\cdot)^{n}} G_m$ be the $n$'th power map.
It is a $G=\Z/n\Z$ torsor.
The ring map is $R[t, t^{-1}] \xrightarrow[]{t \mapsto t^n} R[t, t^{-1}]$
which corresponds to ring extension: $R[t, t^{-1}] \to R[t^{\frac{1}{n}}, t^{-\frac{1}{n}}]$.
The field of fractions of $\bG_m$ is $K(t)$ and the corresponding map between fields of $\cP \to X$
is $K(t) \xrightarrow[]{t \to t^n} K(t)$. which corresponds to the field extension:
$K(t) \hookrightarrow K(t^{\frac{1}{n}}) = K(t)[X]/(X^n -t)$.
Where $K = Frac R$

The points $0, \infty \in \bP^1$ correspond to the local rings
$\Oo_{0} = K[t]_{(t)}$ and $\Oo_{\infty} = K[\frac{1}{t}]_{(\frac{1}{t})}$ of $K(t)$,
which are DVRs. The corresponding valuations of $K(t)$ are given by:
\[
    v_0\left(\frac{f}{g}\right) = \text{maximal exponent } n \text{ s.t. } t^{n} \mid \frac{f}{g}, \quad v_\infty\left(\frac{f}{g}\right) = \deg g - \deg f
\]

So the diagram of the G-torsor $\cP=\bG_m$ over $\bG_m$ is:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{tikzcd}
        & \cP=\mathbb{G}_m \ar[d, "(\cdot)^n"] \\
        \bP^1 & \arrow[l] \bG_m
    \end{tikzcd}
\end{equation}

The bounded ramification condition is given by:
\begin{equation}
    \text{ram } P_{\eta} \leq k
\end{equation}

We wish to understand


In the general case of a $G$ torsor $P \to C$ we have similarly:
$K(C) \cong K(t)$ the function ring of $C$ for some variable $t$ and a finite field extension $K/\F_p(t')$.
If the basefield $K$ contains $n$'th roots of unity, then the torsor is the same... and continue here:
$\Oo_{P_1}$
the same..
and continue.
