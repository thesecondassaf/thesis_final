The main theorem of this section is
\begin{restatable}{theorem}{SymmetricPowerOfSheafIsTamelyRamified}\label{theorem:SymmetricPowerOfSheafIsTamelyRamified}
     Let $\Lambda$ be a finite ring of cardinality invertible in $k$, and let $\cF$ be an \'etale sheaf of $\Lambda$-modules, locally free of rank 1 on $U$, with ramification bounded by $\mdls$. 
     Considering $U^{(d)}$ as an open subscheme of the blowup $\tilde{C}^{(d)}_\mdls$ of $C^{(d)}$, we have that
     for sufficiently large integer $d$, $\cF^{(d)}$ is tamely ramified on $H= \tilde{C}^{(d)}_\mdls \setminus U^{(d)}=Z_0 \times_{C^{(d)}} \tilde{C}^{(d)}_\mdls $.
