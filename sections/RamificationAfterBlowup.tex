The main theorem of this section is
\begin{restatable}{theorem}{SymmetricPowerOfSheafIsTamelyRamified}\label{theorem:SymmetricPowerOfSheafIsTamelyRamified}
     Let $\Lambda$ be a finite ring of cardinality invertible in $k$, and let $\cF$ be an \'etale sheaf of $\Lambda$-modules, locally free of rank 1 on $U$, with ramification bounded by $\mdls$. 
     Considering $U^{(d)}$ as an open subscheme of the blowup $\tilde{C}^{(d)}_\mdls$ of $C^{(d)}$, we have that
     for sufficiently large integer $d$, $\cF^{(d)}$ is tamely ramified on $H= \tilde{C}^{(d)}_\mdls \setminus U^{(d)}=Z_0 \times_{C^{(d)}} \tilde{C}^{(d)}_\mdls $.
\end{restatable}

More over, this compactification, denoted by $\tilde{C}^{(d)}_\mdls$ is fibered over $\PicCm[d]$ with fibers isomorphic to projective spaces. Thus we get
$$ \pi_1(\tilde{C}^{(d)}_\mdls) \cong \pi_1(\PicCm[d])$$

From here, one can go in two routes, 
\textbf{Route 1} - Showing $ \ker \{\pi^{ab}_1(U^{(d)}) \to \pi^{ab}_1(\PicCm[d]) \} $ is pro-$p$ group. 

\textbf{Route 2} - Showing $$\pi^{t, ab}_1(U^{(d)}) \to \pi^{t,ab}_1(\PicCm[d])$$ is isomorphism to its image.  \textcolor{red}{here one needs to be precise.}

In both cases, one would then get \Cref{thm:GCFT_reduced}.

We start by defintions and basic proposition of everything we need.
