We work over $S=\spec k$, for $k$ perfect.

By \Cref{prop:torsor_module_equivalence}, its equivalent to prove: 
\begin{restatable}{theorem}{GCFTtorsors} \label{thm:GCFT_torsors}
    Let $G=\Lambda^\times$ be a finite abelian group ($\Lambda$ as before), and let $\cP$ be a $G$-torsor on $U$, with ramification bounded by $\mdls$. 
    Then, for sufficiently large integer $d$, there exists a unique (up to isomorphism) $G$-torsor $\cQ_d$ on $\PicCm[d]$, such that the pullback of $\cQ_d$ by $\Phi_d$ is isomorphic to $\cP^{(d)}$.
\end{restatable}

\begin{proof}
We divide the proof into two cases, when $\mdls = 0$ and when $\mdls > 0$.

\textbf{Case 1:} $\mdls = 0$.
By \Cref{section:AbelJacobi}, for $d$ large enough,
the Abel-Jacobi morphism $\Phi_d : C^{(d)} \to \PicC[d]$ is proper surjective and smooth, with geometrically connected fibers,
each isomorphic to $\bP_{k^{sep}}^{d-g}$, 
Hence by \Cref{cor:etale_fundamental_group_smooth_proper} it induces an exact sequence of etale fundamental groups:
\[ \pi_1^{et}(\bP_{k^{sep}}^{d-g}) \to \pi_1^{et}(C^{(d)}) \to \pi_1^{et}(\PicC[d]) \to 1 \]
But $\bP_{k^{sep}}^{d-g}$  is simply connected (\cite{tendler2015geometricclassfieldtheory} Example 4.9, \cite{Toth2011} Example 1.4.12), 
hence its etale fundamental group is trivial, and we get an isomorphism of etale fundamental groups:
$$ \pi_1^{et}(C^{(d)}) \cong \pi_1^{et}(\PicC[d]) $$
Implying the theorem in this case.

\textbf{Case 2:} $\mdls > 0$.
In this case by \Cref{theorem:takeuchi-compactification-theorem}, for $d$ large enough, the Abel-Jacobi morphism $\Phi_d : U^{(d)} \to \PicCm[d]$ 
extends to a proper surjective and smooth map, with geometrically connected fibers isomorphic to projective spaces, 
$$ \tilde{\Phi}_d : \tilde{C}^{(d)}_\mdls \to \PicCm[d] $$ 
Hence we get an isomorphism of etale fundamental groups:
$$ \pi_1^{et}(\tilde{C}^{(d)}_\mdls) \cong \pi_1^{et}(\PicCm[d]) $$

By \Cref{theorem:SymmetricPowerOfSheafIsTamelyRamified}, 
$\cF^{(d)}$ is tamely ramified on the boundary divisor $H = \tilde{C}^{(d)}_\mdls \setminus U^{(d)}$.

Thus, by \Cref{lemma:ExtensionOfTamelyRamifiedSheaf} below, we have:
$\cF^{(d)}$ extends to a locally constant sheaf $\tilde{\cF}^{(d)}$ on $\tilde{C}^{(d)}_\mdls$, 
which by the isomorphism of etale fundamental groups above, corresponds to a unique locally constant sheaf $\cG_d$ on $\PicCm[d]$,
such that $\tilde{\Phi}_d^* \cG_d \cong \tilde{\cF}^{(d)}$.
Restricting back to $U^{(d)}$, we get $\Phi_d^* \cG_d \cong \cF^{(d)}$,
as required.
\end{proof}


\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:ExtensionOfTamelyRamifiedSheaf}
    If $\cF^{(d)}$ is a locally constant sheaf on $U^{(d)}$ which is tamely ramified along the boundary divisor $H = \tilde{C}^{(d)}_\mdls \setminus U^{(d)}$, 
    then $\cF^{(d)}$ extends to a locally constant sheaf $\tilde{\cF}^{(d)}$ on $\tilde{C}^{(d)}_\mdls$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    \textcolor{red}{The lemma we are referencing above can be proved in two routes:
\\
\textbf{Route 1} - Showing $ \ker \{\pi^{ab}_1(U^{(d)}) \to \pi^{ab}_1(\PicCm[d]) \} $ is pro-$p$ group. \\
\textbf{Route 2} - Showing $$\pi^{t, ab}_1(U^{(d)}) \to \pi^{t,ab}_1(\PicCm[d])$$ is isomorphism to its image.  \textcolor{red}{here one needs to be precise.}
