We work over $S=\spec k$, for $k$ perfect.

By \Cref{prop:torsor_module_equivalence}, its equivalent to prove: 
\GCFTtorsors*

\begin{proof}
We divide the proof into two cases, when $\mdls = 0$ and when $\mdls > 0$.

\textbf{Case 1:} $\mdls = 0$.
By \Cref{section:AbelJacobi}, for $d$ large enough,
the Abel-Jacobi morphism $\Phi_d : C^{(d)} \to \PicC[d]$ is proper surjective and smooth, with geometrically connected fibers,
each isomorphic to $\bP_{k^{sep}}^{d-g}$, 
Hence by \Cref{cor:etale_fundamental_group_smooth_proper} it induces an exact sequence of etale fundamental groups:
\[ \pi_1^{et}(\bP_{k^{sep}}^{d-g}) \to \pi_1^{et}(C^{(d)}) \to \pi_1^{et}(\PicC[d]) \to 1 \]
But $\bP_{k^{sep}}^{d-g}$  is simply connected (\cite{tendler2015geometricclassfieldtheory} Example 4.9, \cite{Toth2011} Example 1.4.12), 
hence its etale fundamental group is trivial, and we get an isomorphism of etale fundamental groups:
$$ \pi_1^{et}(C^{(d)}) \cong \pi_1^{et}(\PicC[d]) $$
Implying the theorem in this case.

\textbf{Case 2:} $\mdls > 0$.
In this case by (\textcolor{red}{add reference later - that the abel jacobi map here extends. - this is Preliminaries}, for $d$ large enough, the Abel-Jacobi morphism $\Phi_d : U^{(d)} \to \PicCm[d]$ 
extends to a proper surjective and smooth map, with geometrically connected fibers isomorphic to projective spaces, 
$$ \tilde{\Phi}_d : \tilde{C}^{(d)}_\mdls \to \PicCm[d] $$ 
Hence we get an isomorphism of etale fundamental groups:
$$ \pi_1^{et}(\tilde{C}^{(d)}_\mdls) \cong \pi_1^{et}(\PicCm[d]) $$

By \Cref{theorem:SymmetricPowerOfSheafIsTamelyRamified}, 
$\cF^{(d)}$ is tamely ramified on the boundary divisor $H = \tilde{C}^{(d)}_\mdls \setminus U^{(d)}$.

Thus, by \textcolor{red}{Add reference to this lemma and state it well} 

\underline{$\cF^{(d)}$ extends to a sheaf $\tilde{\cF}^{(d)}$ on $\tilde{C}^{(d)}_\mdls$ which is unramified along $H$.}
This implies that the representation of $\pi_1^{et}(U^{(d)})$ corresponding to $\cF^{(d)}$ factors through $\pi_1^{et}(\tilde{C}^{(d)}_\mdls)$.
Combining this with the isomorphism above, we get that the representation of $\pi_1^{et}(U^{(d)})$ corresponding to $\cF^{(d)}$ factors through $\pi_1^{et}(\PicCm[d])$, 
which implies the theorem in this case as well.
\end{proof}


\textcolor{red}{The lemma we are referencing above can be proved in two routes:
\\
\textbf{Route 1} - Showing $ \ker \{\pi^{ab}_1(U^{(d)}) \to \pi^{ab}_1(\PicCm[d]) \} $ is pro-$p$ group. \\
\textbf{Route 2} - Showing $$\pi^{t, ab}_1(U^{(d)}) \to \pi^{t,ab}_1(\PicCm[d])$$ is isomorphism to its image.  \textcolor{red}{here one needs to be precise.}
