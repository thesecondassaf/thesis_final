In this section we prove \Cref{theorem:SymmetricPowerOfSheafIsTamelyRamified}
Where here, we already know that $H=Z_0 \times_{C^{(d)}} \Cmod{d}$
The method for the proof is by two steps, first, we are going to prove it for $\mdls=dP$, and second we reduce the general case to this.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Assuming $\mdls=dP$}{Assuming m=dP}}
In this subsection we are going to prove \Cref{theorem:SymmetricPowerOfSheafIsTamelyRamified} in the case $\mdls=dP$
