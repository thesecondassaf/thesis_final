\section{Preliminaries}
In this section we recall the necessariy work, including work from \cite{Guignard2018}, \cite{tendler2015geometricclassfieldtheory} and \cite{takeuchi2019blow}.

\subsection{Generalities}

\subsubsection{Equivalence between Torsors and Invertible Modules}
The following proposition establishes the fundamental dictionary between the geometric theory
of principal homogeneous spaces and the algebraic theory of invertible modules.
This equivalence allows us to transport the monoidal structure from the category of modules
(the tensor product) to the category of torsors (the contracted product),
strictly within the categorical framework.

\begin{prop}\label{prop:torsor_module_equivalence}
    Let $\mathcal{E}$ be a topos and let $\Lambda$ be a ring object in $\mathcal{E}$. Let $G = \Lambda^\times$ denote the internal group object of units of $\Lambda$.

    There is a canonical equivalence of monoidal categories between the category of $G$-torsors in $\mathcal{E}$ and the category of locally free $\Lambda$-modules of rank 1 in $\mathcal{E}$:
    \[
        \Phi: \mathbf{Tors}(\mathcal{E}, \Lambda^\times) \xrightarrow{\sim} \mathbf{Pic}(\mathcal{E}, \Lambda)
    \]
    The equivalence is defined by the associated module functor:
    \[
        P \longmapsto P \times^{\Lambda^\times} \Lambda := \Lambda^\times \backslash (\Lambda \times P)
    \]
    where the quotient is taken with respect to the diagonal action of $\Lambda^\times$ on $\Lambda \times P$. The inverse functor associates to an invertible module $L$ its sheaf of basis frames $\underline{\mathrm{Isom}}_\Lambda(\Lambda, L)$.
\end{prop}

In light of this canonical equivalence, we will pass freely between the language of $G$-torsors and that of locally free $\Lambda$-modules throughout the text.

For a topos $\cE$, a group object $G$ in $\cE$ and an object $X$ in $\cE$, there is a canonical identification
between $({G\cE})_{/X}$ and $G(\cE_{/X})$, given by endowing $X$ with the trivial $G$-action.

We denote by $\mathbf{Tors}(X, G)$ the category of $G$-torsors over $X$ in $G \cE_{/X}$.
Similarly, for a ring object $\Lambda$ in $\cE$, we denote by $\mathbf{Pic}(X, \Lambda)$ the category of locally free $\Lambda$-modules of rank 1 over $X$ in $\cE_{/X}$.
The above equivilance of categories becomes 
\[
    \Phi_X: \mathbf{Tors}(X, \Lambda^\times) \xrightarrow{\sim} \mathbf{Pic}(X, \Lambda)
\].


\subsubsection{Ramification of Sheaves}
\textcolor{red}{Define and discuss a bit}

\subsubsection{Symmetric Powers of Schemes and Torsors}
%We recall the notion of symmetric powers of schemes and torsors, following \cite{Guignard2018} and \cite{SGA1}.

There are several important theorems that repeat themselves throughout deligne approach to class field theory,
one of them, is that the symmetric power of $C$ over $k$, denoted by $C^{(d)}$, is a scheme over $k$,
Guigard proves this in the most general setting so we qoute his result here:
\begin{prop}
    If $X$ is Zariski locally quasi-projective over a scheme $S$, the the right action of $S_d$ on $X^{\times_S d}$ 
    is admissible, and the quotient $X^{(d)} = X^{\times_S d}/S_d$ exists as a scheme over $S$.
\end{prop}
\textcolor{red}{treat more carefully}


\subsubsection{Etale Fundamental Groups and Tame Fundamental Groups}
We recall the definition and basic properties of the etale fundamental group, following stacks project 
\stackstag{0BQ6}
\begin{prop}[\stackstag{0C0J}]
Let $f : X \to S$ be a flat proper morphism of finite presentation whose geometric fibres are connected and reduced. Assume $S$ is connected and let $\overline{s}$ be a geometric point of $S$. Then there is an exact sequence

\[ \pi _1(X_{\overline{s}}) \to \pi _1(X) \to \pi _1(S) \to 1 \]
of fundamental groups.
    
\end{prop}

\begin{cor}\label{cor:etale_fundamental_group_smooth_proper}
    Let $f : X \to S$ be a proper smooth morphism of finite presentation whose geometric fibres are connected. Assume $S$ is connected and let $\overline{s}$ be a geometric point of $S$. Then there is an exact sequence

    \[ \pi _1(X_{\overline{s}}) \to \pi _1(X) \to \pi _1(S) \to 1 \]
    of fundamental groups.
\end{cor}
\textcolor{red}{add about tameness?}


\subsection{Generalized Picard Scheme}
In this section, we recall the notion of generalized Jacobian varieties and study their fundamental properties. The material presented here is primarily adapted from \cite{Guignard2018} and \cite{takeuchi2019blow}. For further background on the general theory of abelian varieties and Jacobians, the reader may also consult \cite{milneAV}.
Let $S$ be a scheme and let $C$ be a projective smooth $S$-scheme whose geometric fibers are connected and of dimension 1. Let $\mdls$ be a modulus on $C$, defined as an effective Cartier divisor of $C/S$ 
(i.e., a closed subscheme of $C$ which is finite flat of finite presentation over $S$).
We denote the projection $C \times_S T \to T$ by $\text{pr}$ for any $S$-scheme $T$.

\subsubsection*{The Functor of Points}
Let $d$ be an integer. For an $S$-scheme $T$, we consider the set of data $(\cL, \psi)$ where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\cL$ is an invertible sheaf of degree $d$ on $C_T$.
    \item $\psi: \Oo_{\mdls_T} \xrightarrow{\sim} \cL|_{\mdls_T}$ is a trivialization of $\cL$ along the modulus.
\end{itemize}
Two such pairs $(\cL, \psi)$ and $(\cL', \psi')$ are said to be isomorphic if there exists an isomorphism of invertible sheaves $f : \cL \to \cL'$ such that the following diagram commutes:
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
& \Oo_{\mdls_T} \arrow[dl, "\psi'"'] \arrow[dr, "\psi"] & \\
\cL'|_{\mdls_T} \arrow[rr, "f|_{\mdls_T}"] & & \cL|_{\mdls_T}
\end{tikzcd}
\]
We define the presheaf $\text{Pic}_{C, \mdls}^{d, \text{pre}}$ on $\text{Sch}/S$ by assigning to $T$ the set of isomorphism classes of such pairs. Let $\PicCm[d]$ denote the \'etale sheafification of this presheaf.

\subsubsection*{Representability and Structure}
The fundamental properties of this functor are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $\text{Pic}_{C, \mdls}^{d}$ is represented by an $S$-scheme. (Note: If $\mdls$ is faithfully flat over $S$, the presheaf is already an \'etale sheaf).
    \item $\text{Pic}_{C, \mdls}^{0}$ is a smooth commutative group $S$-scheme with geometrically connected fibers, referred to as the \textit{generalized Jacobian variety} of $C$ with modulus $\mdls$.
    \item For any $d$, $\text{Pic}_{C, \mdls}^{d}$ is a $\text{Pic}_{C, \mdls}^{0}$-torsor.
\end{enumerate}
In the case where $\mdls = 0$, we recover the standard Jacobian variety, denoted simply as $\text{Pic}_C^d$.
\subsubsection*{Relation to the Standard Jacobian}
We now examine the behavior of the generalized Picard scheme under the variation of the modulus. By viewing the structure along the modulus as an additional rigidification, we obtain natural transition maps corresponding to the inclusion of moduli.

Let $\mdls_1$ and $\mdls_2$ be moduli such that $\mdls_1 \subset \mdls_2$. There exists a natural map 
\[
\text{Pic}_{C, \mdls_2}^d \to \text{Pic}_{C, \mdls_1}^d
\]
obtained by restricting the isomorphism $\psi$. Since $\mdls_2$ is a finite $S$-scheme, this map is a surjection as a morphism of \'etale sheaves.
In particular, for any modulus $\mdls$, there is a natural surjective morphism of \'etale sheaves:
\[
\text{Pic}_{C, \mdls}^d \to \text{Pic}_C^d.
\]


\subsubsection*{Local Freeness and Base Change}
%\textcolor{red}{there is ${\mdls}$ here - should fix that}
Let $\mdls$ be a modulus which is everywhere strictly positive. Let $g$ denote the genus of $C$, which is a locally constant function on $S$. We restrict our attention to degrees $d$ satisfying the condition:
\begin{equation} \label{equation:degree-condition}
    d \geq \max\{2g - 1 + \deg \mdls, \deg \mdls\}.
\end{equation}

Assuming $S$ is quasi-compact, such a $d$ always exists.

Fix an integer $d$ satisfying the condition above. Let $T$ be an $S$-scheme and let $\cL$ be an invertible sheaf of degree $d$ on $C_T$. One can show that the pushforwards $\mathrm{pr}_* \cL$ and $\mathrm{pr}_* \cL(-{\mdls})$ are locally free sheaves and their formations commute with any base change. Explicitly, for any morphism of $S$-schemes $f : T' \to T$, the base change morphisms are isomorphisms:
\[
    f^* \mathrm{pr}_* \cL \xrightarrow{\sim} \mathrm{pr}_* f^* \cL
\]
and
\[
    f^* \mathrm{pr}_* (\cL(-{\mdls})) \xrightarrow{\sim} \mathrm{pr}_* f^* (\cL(-{\mdls})).
\]
In particular, following \cite{Guignard2018}, if $\cL$ is invertible $\cO_C$-module with degree $d$ satisfying \ref{equation:degree-condition} on each fiber of $f$ then, $\mathrm{pr}_* \cL$ is a locally free $\mathcal{O}_S$-module of rank $d-g+1$.

For further background and verification of these constructions, we refer the reader to Milne's notes on Abelian Varieties (\cite{milneAV}).

\subsection{The Abel-Jacobi Morphism and its Fibers}\label{section:AbelJacobi}


Let $U = C \setminus \mdls$ be the complement of the modulus in $C$.
The effective cartier divisors of degree $d$ which are prime to $\mdls$ are parameterized by the symmetric power $\Sym_S^d (U) = U^{(d)}$ over $S$ (See \cite{Guignard2018} Proposition 4.12, \cite{milneAV} Theorem 3.13).
For any such divisor $D \in U^{(d)}$, the associated line bundle $\Oo_C(D)$ admits a canonical trivialization along $\mdls$. 
Specifically, the canonical section $1_D$ is regular and non-vanishing on $\mdls$ because $\operatorname{supp}(D) \cap \operatorname{supp}(\mdls) = \emptyset$. 
This section restricts to a nowhere-vanishing section on the subscheme $\mathfrak{m}$, thereby determining a trivialization $\psi_D^{-1}: \Oo_C(D)|_{\mdls} \xrightarrow{\sim} \Oo_{\mdls}$.
This is done functorially in families, yielding a morphism from the symmetric power to the generalized Picard scheme (over $S$):
\begin{equation}
    \Phi_{d}: U^{(d)} \to \Pic^d_{C, \mathfrak{m}}, \quad D \mapsto [(\mathcal{O}_C(D), \psi_D)],
\end{equation}

When $\mdls = 0$, $d \geq max \{2g - 1, 0\}$ and $C$ admits a section over $S$, $C^{(d)}$ is a projective space bundle over $\PicC[d]$, 
It is proper, surjective with geometrically connected fibers.

Guignard (\cite{Guignard2018} Theorem 4.14) proves that for $\mdls > 0$ and $d$ satisfying \Cref{equation:degree-condition}, the Abel-Jacobi morphism $\Phi_d$ is 
surjective smooth of relative dimension $d - \deg \mdls - g + 1$, with geometrically connected fibers. 

When $S=\spec (k)$, the geometric-fibers of $\Phi_d$ are well understood:
\begin{theorem}
    Assuming $S=\spec (k)$ and $d \geq max \{2g - 1 + \deg \mdls, \deg \mdls\}$. Then, the geometric-fibers of the Abel-Jacobi morphism $$ \Phi_d : U^{(d)} \to \PicCm[d] $$ over any point are isomorphic to
$$
\begin{cases}
\mathbb{A}_{k^{sep}}^{d - \deg \mdls - g + 1} & \text{if } m > 0 \\
\mathbb{P}_{k^{sep}}^{d - g} & \text{if } m = 0
\end{cases}
$$
In both cases $\Phi_d$ is a fibration in affine spaces or projective spaces, depending on whether $\mdls$ is non-zero or zero.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
see \cite{tendler2015geometricclassfieldtheory} Propositions 3.13-3.14, or \cite{Toth2011} Prop 2.1.4:

\subsection{Blowup of Symmetric Curves}
For $P \to U$ a $G$-torsor. We denote by $P^{[d]} \to U^{(d)}$ the corresponding $G$-torsor over $U^{(d)}$.
Let $\eta^i$ be the generic point of the exceptional divisor $E^i$ of the blowup of $C^{(d_i n_i)}$ by $n_i P_i$
(Where $deg P_i = d_i$).
Where $P_i \in C \setminus U$
We want to prove:
\begin{prop}
    If $ram P^{[d_1n_1]}_{\eta^1} \leq k_1 $ and $ram P^{[d_2n_2]}_{\eta^2} \leq k_2 $
    Then $ram P^{[d_1n_1 + d_2n_2]}_{\eta} = max(k_1, k_2)$ where $\eta$ is the generic point of the exceptional divisor $E$ of the blowup of $C^{(d_1 n_1 + d_2n_2)}$ by $\mdls= n_1 P_1 + n_2P_2$
\end{prop}





This follows by the following:
Start talking about local rings, and take everything locally and prove it locally.
\begin{prop}
    Let
\end{prop}sss


\textbf{Proposition 6 is proved in takeuchi's paper \cite{takeuchi2019blow}.}
We show here a simpler proof for a simpler case that we would need.

Let $\cP$ be a $G$-torsor over $U$.
Let $\mdls = n_1 P_1 + n_2 P_2 = \mdls_1 + \mdls_2$ be a modulus on $C$.
Let $X_{\mdls_1}, X_{\mdls_2}$ be the blowups of $C^{(\deg \mdls_1)}, C^{(\deg \mdls_2)}$ by $\mdls_1, \mdls_2$ respectively.  
Let $E_1, E_2$ be the respective exceptional divisors, and let $\eta_1$, $\eta_2$ be their generic points respectively.

\begin{prop}\label{prop:box-tame-ram}
Assume $\cP^{(\deg \mdls_1)}$, $\cP^{(\deg \mdls_2)}$ are tamely ramified on $\eta_1, \eta_2$  respectively.
Then, $\boxP{\cP^{(\deg \mdls_1)}}{\cP^{(\deg \mdls_2)}}$ is tamely ramified on $\eta_1 \times \eta_2 \in C^{(\deg \mdls_1)} \times C^{(\deg \mdls_2)}$
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
    \textcolor{red}{Write proof here}
\end{proof}

Next, we prove:
\begin{prop}\label{prop:blowup-prop}
    Let $X,Y$ be smooth over $k$. $x\in X, y\in Y$ closed points. Let $\Bl_x(X), \Bl_y(Y), \allowbreak Bl_{(x,y)}(X\times_k Y) $ be the respective blowups. 
    Let $\eta_X, \eta_Y,\eta_{X\times Y}$ be the generic points of the exceptional divisor of the respective blowups. 
    Then, there exists a scheme $\tilde{U}$ and maps $f_1, f_2$ making the diagram commute:
    
    \begin{diagram}
         \begin{tikzcd}
            {} & \tilde{U} \arrow[dl, "f_1"] \arrow[dr, hook, "f_2"] & {} \\
            \Bl_x(X)\times_k \Bl_y(Y) & {} & \Bl_{(x,y)}(X\times_k Y)
        \end{tikzcd}
    \end{diagram}
    such that:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $f_2$ is open immersion
        \item $f_1$ is open map (?open immersion?)
        \item $\eta_{X\times Y} \in \tilde{U}$
        \item $\eta_{X\times Y} \overset{f_1}{\mapsto} \eta_X \times \eta_Y$ 
    \end{enumerate}
\end{prop}

Let $P^{[d]} \to U^{(d)}$ be the corresponding $G$-torsor over $U^{(d)}$.


\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:boxplus}
Let $p: C^{(d)} \times_k C^{(n-d)} \xrightarrow[]{+} C^{(n)}$ be the plus map, restricting $p$ to $U^{(d)} \times_k U^{(n-d)}$ we get a map 
$$p: U^{(d)} \times_k U^{(n-d)} \xrightarrow[]{p} U^{(n)}$$
Then, $$p^* (\cP^{(n)}) \cong \boxPp {\cP^{[d]}}{\cP^{(n-d)}}[k]$$
\end{lemma}

\begin{prop}
    Combinining \Cref{prop:box-tame-ram}, \Cref{prop:blowup-prop} and \Cref{lemma:boxplus} we get that if $P^{[d_1 n_1]}$, $P^{[d_2 n_2]}$ are tamely ramified on $\eta_1, \eta_2$ respectively, then $P^{[d_1 n_1 + d_2 n_2]}$ is tamely ramified on $\eta$ the generic point of the exceptional divisor of the blowup of $C^{(d_1 n_1 + d_2 n_2)}$ by $\mdls = n_1 P_1 + n_2 P_2$.
\end{prop}

\textbf{A few notes}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item takeuchi's paper \cite{takeuchi2019blow} proves a more general version of \Cref{prop:blowup-prop} for arbitrary ramificiation, not necessarily smooth over a field.
    more generally, he proves:
        \begin{prop}\label{prop:ram-blowup}
        If $ram P^{[d_1n_1]}_{\eta^1} = k_1 $ and $ram P^{[d_2n_2]}_{\eta^2} = k_2 $
        Then $ram P^{[d_1n_1 + d_2n_2]}_{\eta} = max(k_1, k_2)$ where $\eta$ is the generic point of the exceptional divisor $E$ of the blowup of $C^{(d_1 n_1 + d_2n_2)}$ by $\mdls= n_1 P_1 + n_2P_2$
        \end{prop}

    \item more generally, the above works for any finite number of points $P_i$ with multiplicities $n_i$. the generalizaiton is easy.
    
\end{enumerate}
\textcolor{red}{ass somewhere the defintiion of box product}


\begin{lemma}
     Let $\ndls_1, \ndls_2 \subset \mdls$ be two moduli of the form $\ndls_1 = k_1 P_1$, $\ndls_2 = k_2 P_2$ where $P_1, P_2$ are distinct points.
     Let $\cF_1, \cF_2$ be local systems on $U^{(\deg \ndls_1)}$, $U^{(\deg \ndls_2)}$, at most tamely ramified at $\eta_{\ndls_1}$, $\eta_{\ndls_2}$ respectively.
     Then the local system $\boxP{\cF_1}{\cF_2} := p_1^{-1}(\cF_1) \otimes p_2^{-1}(\cF_2)$ on is at most tamely ramified at the point $\eta_{\ndls_1} \times \eta_{\ndls_2}$ of 

     Let $\cF$ be a local system on $U^{(d)}$
\end{lemma}

\subsection{Compactification of Blowup of Symmetric Powers Curve}\label{section:BlowupOfSymmetricPowerOfCurves}
We recall that our objective is to descend the local system $\cF^{(d)}$ from $U^{(d)}$ to $\PicCm[d]$ along the 
Abel-Jacobi map $\Phi_d$:

\[
\begin{tikzcd}
 \cF^{(d)} \arrow[d, purple]\\
 U^{(d)} \arrow[r, "\Phi_d"] & \PicCm[d]      
\end{tikzcd}
\]


(Here, the purple arrow emphasizes that the morphism is of sheaves on the étale site).

However, we encounter an obstruction: in the case we are considering ($\mdls > 0$), 
the fibers of $\Phi_d$ are affine spaces (of the same degree) rather than the better-behaved projective spaces. 
This hint that a solution to this problem is to compactify the morphism to yield projective fibers. 
 
This section describes the result of the compactification constructed by \cite{takeuchi2019blow} 
via the method of blowup.

Let $\mdls = \sum_{i=1}^n k_P P$ with $\deg P = d_P$ be a modulus on $C$, and let $d$ satisfy 
\Cref{equation:degree-condition}. 
Takeuchi (\cite{takeuchi2019blow}) defines $Z_0=Z_0(\mathfrak{m}, d)$ as the closed subscheme of 
$C^{(d)}$ defined by the map $C^{(d - \deg \mathfrak{m})} \to C^{(d)}$ adding $\mathfrak{m}$. 
He also defines $X_{\mathfrak{m}, d}$ as the blowup of $C^{(d)}$ along $Z_0$.
Let $E_0 = E_{\mathfrak{m},d} = Z_0(\mathfrak{m}, d) \times_{C^{(d)}} X_{\mathfrak{m}, d}$ be the exceptional divisor of the blowup. It is irreducible of codimension 1, and we let $\eta_0=\eta_{\mathfrak{m}, d}$ be its generic point.

%This section describes the compactification constructed by Takeuchi \cite{takeuchi2019blow} using the blowup method

% Let $\mdls = \sum_{i=1}^n k_P P$ with $\deg P = d_P$ be a modulus on $C$. Let $d$ satisfy \Cref{equation:degree-condition}.
% Takeuchi (\cite{takeuchi2019blow}) defines $Z_0=Z_0(\mdls, d)$ as the closed subscheme of $C^{(d)}$ defined by the map $C^{(d - \deg \mdls)} \to C^{(d)}$ adding $\mdls$.
% He also defines $X_{\mdls, d}$ as the blowup of $C^{(d)}$ along $Z_0$. 
% Let $E_0 = E_{\mdls,d} = Z_0(\mdls, d) \times_{C^{(d)}} X_{\mdls, d}$ 
% be the exceptional divisor of the blowup, it is irreducible of codimension 1, let $\eta_0=\eta_{\mdls, d}$ be its generic point.

Diagrammatically:
\[\begin{tikzcd}
\overline{\{\eta_0 \}} =  E_0 \arrow[r] \arrow[d] & X_{\mdls, d} \arrow[d, "\pi"] \\
Z_0 \arrow[r, "c.i"]           & C^{(d)}          
\end{tikzcd}\] 

Incoporating $U^{(d)}$, the local system $\cF^{(d)}$ and the Abel-Jacobi map, we have:
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
    & & \cF^{(d)} \arrow[d, purple]\\
\overline{\{\eta_0 \}} =  E_0 \arrow[r] \arrow[d] & 
X_{\mdls, d} \arrow[d, "\pi"]  & \arrow[l, hook'] \arrow[dl, hook'] U^{(d)} \arrow[r, "\Phi_d"] & \PicCm[d] \\
Z_0 \arrow[r, "c.i"]           & C^{(d)}          
\end{tikzcd}
\] 

In Section 3 of \cite{takeuchi2019blow} Takeuchi constructs, for large enough $d$ a compactification denoted by $\Cmod{d}$ and proves the following:
\textcolor{red}{exactly determined the fate of that d}

\begin{theorem}[Takeuchi]\label{theorem:takeuchi-compactification-theorem}
    The scheme $\Cmod{d}$ is an open subscheme of $X_{\mdls,d}$ containing $U^{(d)}$. 
    The morphism $\Phi_d: U^{(d)} \to \PicCm[d]$ extends to a morphism $\tilde{\Phi}_d: \Cmod{d} \to \PicCm[d]$ which makes 
    $\Cmod{d}$ a projective space bundle over $\PicCm[d]$. 
    Furthermore, the complement of $U^{(d)}$ in $\Cmod{d}$ is isomorphic to the fiber product 
    $E_0 \times_{C^{(d)}} \Cmod{d}$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    \textcolor{red}{Add outline of construction and proofs}

% %We remind, following the introduction, is that our mission is to decsend $\cF^{(d)}$ to $\PicCm[d]$ via $\Phi_d$. For this we don't consider the blowup. 

% In this section we define the blowup of $C^{(d)}$ by $Z_0$ and give its basic properties. As outlined in \cite{takeuchi2019blow}
% Let $C^{(d)}$ be the $d$'th symmetric product of $C$, which parametrizes effective Cartier
% divisor of $deg = d$ on $C$. Let $Z_0$ be the closed subscheme of $C^{(d)}$ defined by the map

% Where
% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item \cite{takeuchi2019blow}[Lemma 3.1.] $P_\mdls^{d}$ is an etale sheaf on $Sch/S$ defined by:
%     $$P_{\mdls}^{d}(T) = \left\{ (\cL, \phi) \;\middle|\; \cL \in \operatorname{Pic}^{d}(C_T), \; \phi: \mathcal{O}_T \hookrightarrow pr_*(\cL/\cL(-\mdls)) \text{ s.t. } \operatorname{coker}(\phi) \text{ is loc. free} \right\} \Big/ \!\cong$$
%     (Isomorphism between two $(\cL, \phi), (\cL', \phi')$ is an isomorphism $f: \cL \xrightarrow{\cong} \cL'$ such that $pr_*(f) \circ \phi = \phi'$)
%     Moreover, it is represented by a proper smooth $S$-algebraic space. Assuming $C \to S$ has a section (\textcolor{red}{This seems rather imporant, it is also used to show $Pic_C^d$ as explicit expression as a sheaf, how do I refer to it }),
%     And letting $\cL'$ be a representative invertible sheaf of the universal class, \cite{takeuchi2019blow} shows that as sheaves on $Sch/\PicCm[d]$, $P_\mdls^d$ is isomorphic to the projectivization $\bP(pr_*(\cL'/\cL'(-\mdls)))$.
%     \item $\PicCm[d] \rightarrow P_\mdls^{d}$ is defined by $(\cL, \psi) \mapsto (\cL, \phi)$.  Where $\phi$ is defined as the composition
%     $$\Oo_T \to pr_* \Oo_{\mdls_T} \xrightarrow[]{pr_* \psi} pr_* (\cL/\cL(-\mdls)) $$. \cite{takeuchi2019blow}[Lemma 3.5] Shows this map is an open immersion.
%     \item The map $P_\mdls^d \to \PicCm[d]$ is by forgetting $\phi$
%     \item The definition of $X_{\mdls, d} \to P_\mdls$ is more technically involved, so we refer the reader to \cite{takeuchi2019blow}. But an imporant feature it is that
%     $X_{\mdls, d}$ is a projective space bundle over $P_\mdls^d$ via that map. 
%     \item $\Cmod{d}$ is an $S$-scheme, defined as the fibered product
%     \begin{tikzcd}
%     \Cmod{d} \arrow[r] \arrow[d, hook] 
%     & \mathrm{Pic}_{C,\mathfrak{m}}^{d} \arrow[d, hook] \\
%     X_{\mathfrak{m}} \arrow[r] 
%     & P_{\mathfrak{m}}^{d},
% \end{tikzcd}
% Hence, The $S$-Scheme $\Cmod{d}$ is a projective space bundle on $\PicCm[d]$ and an open subscheme of $X_{\mdls, d}$.
% \end{enumerate}
% Where for a scheme $X$ and a locally free sheaf of finite rank $\mathcal{F}$ on $X$. We use a contra-Grothendieck notation for a projective space. 
% Thus the $X$-scheme $\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{F})$ parametrizes invertible subsheaves of $\mathcal{F}$.

% Now focusing on the left side of \Cref{diag:main-blowup-diag}, \cite{takeuchi2019blow} shows:

% \begin{enumerate}[start=6]
%     \item $U^{(d)} \to \Cmod{d}$ is an open immersion, and as an open subscheme, $U^{(d)}$ is the complement of $Z_0 \times_{C^{(d)}} \Cmod{d}$
% \end{enumerate}
% \end{theorem}.
