\section{Class Field Theory In the language of Adeles and Ideles}
The modern formulation of Global Class Field Theory is given in terms of the adele and idele groups of a global field. In this chapter we will define these objects and state the main theorems of Class Field Theory in this language.
\subsection{Adeles and Ideles}
Let $K$ be a global field. For each place $v$ of $K$, we denote:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $K_v$ = the completion of $K$ at $v$
    \item $\pp_v$ = the corresponding prime ideal in the ring of integers $\Oo_K$ of $K$
    \item $\Oo_v$ = the ring of integers of $K_v$ 
    \item $\hat{\pp}_v$ = the completion of $\pp_v$ = the maximal ideal of $\Oo_v$
\end{enumerate}
 We define the \textbf{adele ring} of $K$ as the restricted direct product
\[\A_K = \prod_v' K_v
\]
where the restriction is taken with respect to the rings of integers $\Oo_v$ of $K_v$ for all non-archimedean places $v$. In other words, an adele is a tuple $(x_v)_v$ with $x_v \in K_v$ such that $x_v \in \Oo_v$ for all but finitely many non-archimedean places $v$.
The \textbf{idele group} of $K$ is defined as the group of units of the adele ring:
\[\I_K = \A_K^\times = \prod_v' K_v^\times
\]
where the restriction is taken with respect to the unit groups $\Oo_v^\times$ of the rings of integers $\Oo_v$ for all non-archimedean places $v$. An idele is thus a tuple $(x_v)_v$ with $x_v \in K_v^\times$ such that $x_v \in \Oo_v^\times$ for all but finitely many non-archimedean places $v$.  

The field $K$ embeds diagonally into $\mathbb{A}_K$, and thus $K^\times$ embeds diagonally into $\mathbb{I}_K$ as the subgroup of principal ideles. The \textbf{idele class group} $C_K$ is the quotient:
\[C_K = \I_K / K^\times\]

\subsection{The Main Theorems}
The theory establishes a fundamental connection between the idele class group $C_K$ and the Galois group of the maximal abelian extension of $K$, denoted $K^{ab}$.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{The Global Reciprocity Map}: There exists a canonical continuous homomorphism, the \textbf{Artin map}, from the idele class group to the absolute abelian Galois group:
    $$\theta_K: C_K \to \text{Gal}(K^{ab}/K)$$
    \textcolor{red}{In the case of function fields this map is injective with dense image.}
    \item \textbf{Reciprocity Law}: For any finite abelian extension $L/K$, the Artin map induces a canonical isomorphism:
    $$C_K / N_{L/K}(C_L) \xrightarrow{\sim} \text{Gal}(L/K)$$
    where $N_{L/K}: C_L \to C_K$ is the norm map on the idele class groups. The subgroup $N_{L/K}(C_L)$ is an open subgroup of finite index in $C_K$.
    \textcolor{red}{The norm map on the idele class group is somewhat differet}
    \item \textbf{Existence Theorem}: There is a one-to-one, inclusion-reversing correspondence between the set of finite abelian extensions of $K$ and the set of open subgroups of finite index in the idele class group $C_K$.
    $$
    \begin{Bmatrix}
    \text{Finite abelian} \\
    \text{extensions } L/K
    \end{Bmatrix}
    \quad \longleftrightarrow \quad
    \begin{Bmatrix}
    \text{Open subgroups } H \subseteq C_K \\
    \text{of finite index}
    \end{Bmatrix}
    $$
    Under this correspondence, an extension $L$ corresponds to the subgroup $H = N_{L/K}(C_L)$.
\end{enumerate}

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Above is finite adelic formulation of CFT, state somethign about the infinite extension CFT theorem
        \item State something about the topology on the idele class group, Say how the fintie implies the infinte by taking inverse limits. 
        \item Find sources for the above. for exampel milne? maybe other?
        \item The restriction is for the non-archimedean, are you sure?
        \item What is the topology of the "continious" homomorphism?
    \end{enumerate}
    }


\subsection{The connection between the idealic and adelic formulations}
We begin with a few notations, let $\mdls=\sum n_v \pp_v$ be a modulus of $K$, i.e. an effective divisor on the curve corresponding to $K$, $\Supp(\mdls)$ is the 
set of valuations that occur with nonzero coefficient in $\mdls$, and $\bO_{\mdls}^\times = \prod_v W_{\mdls}(v)$ where
\[W_{\mdls}(v) = \begin{cases}
\Oo_v^\times & v \notin \Supp(\mdls)  \\
1 + \hat{\pp_v}^{n_v} & v \in \Supp(\mdls)
\end{cases}
\]

Define 
\[
\I_{\mdls} = \left(\prod_{v \notin \Supp(\mdls)}^{}K_v^\times \times \prod_{v \in \Supp(\mdls)}^{}
 W_{\mdls}(v)  \right) \bigcap \I_K
\]
