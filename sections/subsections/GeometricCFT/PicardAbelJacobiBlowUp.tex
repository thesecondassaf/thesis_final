\textcolor{red}{add reference or proof} $\cF^{(d)}$ can be extended to a sheaf on this compactification with tame ramification along the boundary.
The compactification, denoted by $\tilde{C}^{(d)}_\mdls$ is fibered over $\PicCm[d]$ with fibers isomorphic to projective spaces. 
Hence, \textcolor{red}{show/add ref/add explanation} 

Here we will show 
The compactification has  

blow-up $X_\mdls$ of $C^{(d)}$ along a the closed subscheme $Z_0 \subset C^{(d)}$ defined by the map:






$$
\begin{aligned}
\phi \colon C^{(d - \deg \mdls)} &\to C^{(d)} \\
E &\mapsto E + \mdls
\end{aligned}
$$

He shows the existence of a commutative diagram:
\begin{equation}
\begin{tikzcd}
    % Row 1
    & \tilde{C}_m^{(d_m)} \arrow[r] \arrow[d] \arrow[dr, phantom, "\square"]
    & \text{Pic}_{C,m}^{d_m} \arrow[d, "(3.7)"'] \\
    % Row 2
    X_m \arrow[r, "\cong"] \arrow[dr]
    & \mathbb{P}(\mathcal{E}_m) \arrow[r] \arrow[d, "(3.5)"']
    & P_m^{d_m} \arrow[d, "(3.2)"'] \\
    % Row 3
    & C^{(d_m)}
    & \text{Pic}_C^{d_m}
\end{tikzcd}
\end{equation}
